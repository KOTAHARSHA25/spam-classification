# AI-Powered Spam Classification System

This project is an **AI-Powered Spam Classification System** that classifies emails as either **Spam** or **Not Spam** using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project includes a robust backend for training and evaluating the spam classifier and an intuitive frontend for real-time email classification.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Classification**: Classify email content as Spam or Not Spam.
- **Confidence Levels**: Provides confidence scores for predictions.
- **Advanced Machine Learning**: Utilizes Gradient Boosting Classifier for high accuracy.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Preprocessing with TF-IDF and lemmatization for efficient text analysis.
- **Balanced Dataset**: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) is used for handling class imbalance.

## üìÇ Project Structure

### Backend
The backend code handles:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Text cleaning (removing noise, stopwords, and special characters).
   - Lemmatization for word normalization.
   - Vectorization using **TF-IDF**.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Training a **Gradient Boosting Classifier** with a balanced dataset.
   - Dataset balancing using **SMOTE**.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Reports accuracy, F1-score, and classification metrics.
   - Outputs the model and vectorizer as `pickle` files.

4. **Dependencies**:
   - `pandas`, `numpy`, `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `imblearn`.

### Frontend
The frontend is a user-friendly **Streamlit** application:
- Takes user input (email content).
- Classifies the email in real-time.
- Displays results with confidence levels.
- Sidebar for example emails.
